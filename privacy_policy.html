    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to RouteSync. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application ("RouteSync" or "the App").</p>
    
    <p>RouteSync is designed to help delivery professionals export their calendar appointments to CSV format for use with route planning applications like Circuit Route Planner.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <li>Generate CSV exports for route planning</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Calendar data is processed locally on your device and is never transmitted to external servers or shared with third parties.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Device Storage</h3>
    <p>The App accesses your device's Downloads folder to save exported CSV files. No other files or data on your device are accessed.</p>
